# Cows and Bulls

We have listed below what is working on our game right now: 

 * When a user first visits our site, they can enter a username for the game
 * Infinite users can access the site and play concurrently with as many as many guesses as they need until someone wins. 
 * Players can chose to either be a player or an observer and if they are a player they can toggle if they’re ready. 
 * Once all players are ready, the game will start.
 * Players can not see the other players guess until they have submitted their own personal guess.
 * Players may leave the game and rejoin with the same username as before.
 * Players are allowed to “Pass” or make no guess for a turn.
 * Whoever guesses the correct number first wins. Multiple users can win if the correct number is guessed on the same turn. 
 * Once someone wins, the game goes back to setup mode, displaying who the last winners were and the win/loss count of each user.
